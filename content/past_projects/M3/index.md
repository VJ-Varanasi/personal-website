Semi-finalist (7th-12th out of 760) in M3's 2020 Mathematical Modeling challenge. 

In this challenge, my team and I modeled the transition of the semi-truck industry towards electric alternatives. Our solution involved first modeling the adoption rate of electric trucks and then modeling the associated infrastructure. Our model consisted of a logarithmic regression to estimate the turning point from diesel to electric trucks and two agents based models to estimate the transition rate and locations of charging stations. A full write up of our solution can be found at: {{% staticref "uploads/M3_Challenge.pdf" "newtab" %}}M3 Solution{{% /staticref %}}
