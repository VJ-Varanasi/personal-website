My senior thesis work with Prof. Jun Korenaga aims to study the emergence of autocatalytic reaction networks in pre-biotic chemical models. Falliing under the larger umbrella of theoretical biology and origin of life research, this project aims to characterize the emergence and stability of autocatalytic reactions in pre-biotic chemical environments. The work highlighted below represents final reports and presentations for PHYS472, the physics senior thesis class at Yale, but the project still remains a work in progress.
