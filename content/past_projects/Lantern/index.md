The summer after my freshman year at Yale, I worked as a data science intern at [Lantern Pharma](https://www.lanternpharma.com/), a biotech company specializing in applying data science techniques to oncology drug discovery. At Lantern, I worked on the feature selection algorithm in RADR, their proprietary drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, I rewrote their correlation module implementing 3 separate correlation methods (Pearson, Spearman, and Kernel-Based RV) across 10+ python scripts.
