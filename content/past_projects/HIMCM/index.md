Earned Outstanding Distinction (top 9 out of 791) in COMAP's 2019 HiMCM Mathematical Modeling challenge. In the challenge, my team and I modeled the economic impact of charging of personal devices in public spaces. Our solution involved creating an agents based model of personal device charging habits and estimating the resulting impact at various public locations. A full write up of our solution can be found at: {{% staticref "uploads/HiMCM_Paper.pdf" "newtab" %}}HiMCM Solution{{% /staticref %}}
