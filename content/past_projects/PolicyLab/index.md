As part of the Yale Policy lab, my team and I worked with Prof. John Dearborn to research the efficacy of adopting a State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) in Connecticut. State Infrastructure Banks are governmental loan programs designed to incentivize construction through low-cost financing options. With the goal of advising Connecticut legislature whether to support an in-state SIB, our project focused conducting SIB case studies, identifying lessons from existing SIBs, and finding potential opportunities for CT. The executive summary and the full brief can be found below. 

**Executive Summary**
- This brief examines the desirability of creating a state infrastructure bank (SIB) in
Connecticut, which has been the subject of recent legislation and debate
- First, the brief summarizes major findings from existing research on SIBs.
- Second, the brief describes how several states offer lessons for Connecticut on the
potential utility and pitfalls of SIBs.
- Overall, this research suggests that a state infrastructure bank can help Connecticut. For it
to be effective, it needs to be properly funded, should conceive of infrastructure broadly
(including climate and energy), and should be attuned to potential social impacts.
