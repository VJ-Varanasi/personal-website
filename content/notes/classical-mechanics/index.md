{{% staticref "uploads/Classical Mechanics Derivations.pdf" "newtab" %}}Classical Mechanics Derivations{{% /staticref %}} is a summary of key ideas and associated derivations from Yale's PHYS410: Classical Mechanics as taught by Prof. Keith Baker in Fall 2021. This course followed *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems by Thorton and Marion*, but the notes omit concepts covered in-depth in introductory physics courses.
