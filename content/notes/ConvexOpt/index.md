These notes originated from Yale's S&DS631: Optimization and Computation as taught by Prof. Zhuoran Yang in Fall 2023. The course loosely follows *Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd* covering convex sets, convex functions, convex optimization and the dual problem. The notes attached cover up to chapter 4 in the Boyd's text.
