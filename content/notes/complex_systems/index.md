These notes originated from Yale's PHYS428: Complex Systems as taught by Prof. Jun Korenaga in Fall 2022. The course loosely follows *Non-linear dynamics and Chaos by Steven Strogatz* covering complex systems, bifurcation theory, deterministic chaos, numerical methods, and linear models among other things
