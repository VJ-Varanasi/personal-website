These notes follow Prof. Ilias Zadik's S&DS551: Stochastic Processes as taught in Spring 2024. The course covers markov chains, martingales, gaussian random variables, brownian motion, diffusion, and stochastic differential equations. The course notes have some gaps which will be revisted when I have time.
