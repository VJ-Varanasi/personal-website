These notes originated from Yale's PHYS440: Quantum Mechanics I as taught by Prof. Ramamurthi Shankar in Fall 2022. The course is the first course in a two sequence series following *Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Ramamurthi Shankar* covering operators, coupled masses, lagrange and hamiltonian methods, postulates of quantum mechanics, schrodinger's equation, ehrenfest's theorem, free particles, particle in a box, scatter, quantum harmonic oscillator, dirac oscillator, uncertainity principle, multiple particles, identical particles, symmetries and invariance,  angular momentum, and the hydrogen atom.
