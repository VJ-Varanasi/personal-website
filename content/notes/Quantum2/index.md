These notes originated from Yale's PHYS441: Quantum Mechanics II as taught by Prof. Ramamurthi Shankar in Spring 2023. The course is the second course in a two sequence series following *Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Ramamurthi Shankar* covering angular momentum, the hydrogen atom, spin, addition of angular momentum, variational and WKB methods, perturbation theory, scattering theory, and the dirac equation.
