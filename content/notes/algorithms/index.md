{{% staticref "uploads/Algorithms.pdf" "newtab" %}}Algorithms{{% /staticref %}} are handwritten course notes originating from Yale's CPSC365: Algorithms as taught by Prof. Dylan McKay in Spring 2023. This course loosely followed *Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden* covering runtime analysis, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, heaps, binary search trees, dynamic programming, flow networks, and P vs. NP.
