Theory of Stats

These notes follow Yale's "MATH310: Complex Analysis" as taught by Prof. Franco Vargas Pallete in Fall 2021. The course follows *Complex Analysis by Theodore Gamelin*, an undergraduate introduction to the field. The course covered roughly the first 9 chapters of Gamelin's text touching on functions of comlpex variables, differentiability of complex functions, complex integration, Cauchy's theorem, series expansions, calculus of residues, and conformal mapping.
