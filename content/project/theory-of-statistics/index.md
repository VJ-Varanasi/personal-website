These notes follow Yale's "S&DS242: Theory of Statistics" as taught by Prof. Zhou Fan in Spring 2022. The course loosely followed *Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis by John Rice* and covered principles of statistical inference, hypothesis testing, estimation, confidence intervals, maximum likeligood, Bayesian analysis, asymptotic approximations, computer simulation, and generalized linear models.
