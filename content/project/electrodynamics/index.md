These notes originated from Yale's PHYS430: Electromagnetic Fields and Optics as taught by Prof. Eduardo Higino da Silva Neto in Spring 2022. The course follows *Introduction to Electrodynamics by David Griffiths* covering electrostatics, electric potentials, electric fields in matter, magnetostatics, magnetic fields in matter, electrodynamics, electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic waves, potentials and fields, radiation, and electrodynamics and relativity.
