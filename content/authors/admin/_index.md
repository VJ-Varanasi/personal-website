I am a rising senior at Yale University studying Physics and Statistics & Data Science. My broad research interests include emergent phenomena, complex systems, non-linear dynamics, and biophysics. At the moment, I am working with Prof. Jun Korenaga (Yale) to understand the emergence and dynamics of autocatalytic reaction networks in pre-biotic chemical models. Additionally, I also work with Prof. Gregory Laughlin (Yale) on modeling the volatility of the S&P500 as a function of populace fear and uncertainty. In the past, I have worked with Prof. Nicholas Christakis (Yale) to estimate COVID-19 infection rates and Prof. Michael Dickey (NC State) to develop room temperature liquid metal thin films. In addition to my scientific research, I briefly worked with the Yale Policy Lab to evaluate the efficacy of adopting a state infrastructure bank in Connecticut. 

Outside of research, I am a quantitative trading intern at IMC Financial Markets, but have experience in strategy & management consulting and data science. In the summer of 2022, I worked at a consulting firm specializing in private equity due dilligence, FinTech growth strategy, and market penetration in the manufacturing sector. Before that, I interned at an oncology drug discovery company and as a volunteer data analyst for a political campaign. I am also passionate about education and have experience as a teaching assistant for Yale's S&DS 365/665: Intermediate Machine Learning and S&DS 238/538: Bayesian Statistics and Probability. Outside of the classroom, I dance as part of Yale Jashan Bhangra, one of Yale's Indian dance groups, enjoy cooking, reading, and watching Arsenal games.

For more information about my experiences, please check out the past projects section of this website. Feel free to contact me for more information regarding any of my interests or experiences at varun.varanasi@yale.edu.
