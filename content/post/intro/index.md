## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between populace fear and S&P500 volatility. Specifically, this project looks at the relationship between the VIX index, a measure of S&P500 volatility, and [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) user data. Metaculus is a community aggregation platform that utilizes its users to predict real-world events. Historically, Metaculus user data has corresponded with times of political and global unrest with spikes occuring at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This project aims to leverage this relationship as an indicator for populace fear/uncertainity and discover the relationship between Metaculus user data and the VIX index with the goal of better understanding market dynamics.
